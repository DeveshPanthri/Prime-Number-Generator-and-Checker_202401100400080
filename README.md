•	A prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and which is divisible by itself or by 1.
•	The main objective of this program is to generate prime numbers within a given range and check whether a given number is prime.
•	In this project we will create algorithm to by conditionals to check and generate prime numbers in a given range. 
•	This project implements Prime Number Generator and Checking using SymPy’ functions to ensure accuracy and efficiency
